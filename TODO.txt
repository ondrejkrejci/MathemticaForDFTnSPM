TODO:

Concerning CP2K pDOS:

you can switch on printing per atom by adding 

&LDOS
  LIST 1..9999
&END

to the pdos section. See link below.

https://manual.cp2k.org/cp2k-4_1-branch/CP2K_INPUT/FORCE_EVAL/DFT/PRINT/PDOS/LDOS.html
CP2K_INPUT / FORCE_EVAL / DFT / PRINT / PDOS / LDOS
manual.cp2k.org
Controls the printing of local PDOS, projected on subsets of atoms given through lists

In  case you want to implement it in the mathematica notebooks, I'd be interested to give it a try.

Cheers
Marc
